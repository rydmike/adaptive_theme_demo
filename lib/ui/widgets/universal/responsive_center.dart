/// A layout with horizontally centered and max width constrained content.
///
/// This type of layout is often used on web pages.
///
/// It provides the following additional features to the content of the page:
/// - Adds a scrollbar
/// - Adds the capability to un-focus a control like a TextFiled by clicking on
///   the background.
/// - Center the content and limit the content width when a given max width
///   constraint is exceeded.
///
///  This version works around the flaw, that you cannot mouse or touch/drag
///  scroll from the expanding margin areas like you could in a Web view.
///  Read more about it here: https://rydmike.com/blog_layout_and_theming
///  The solution is to use a Listener and PointerSignalEvent to manually
///  scroll the content when the user tries to scroll from the margin areas.
///  It still has one issue, and that is that it does not work correctly if
///  the content has both horizontal and vertically scrolling content.
///  Link to how the Listener workaround was obtained wih ChatGPT by
///  Andrea Bizzotto (GH bizz84 Twitter @biz84)
